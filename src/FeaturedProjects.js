          </a>
          <p>
            Users can browse noodle recipes via search or ingredient filters. I
            used the latter feature myself as someone who's trying to cook more
            while using left-over ingredients to prevent waste! Recipes can be
            sorted by amounts of ingredients, prep/cook time, calorie count, and
            ratings. Users can also find top-rated ramen restaurants near them
            via the Google Maps API. If logged in, recipes and restaurant
            locations can be bookmarked. Users can also check other members'
            profiles and mutual bookmarks. Account data is stored and accessed
            within MongoDB database.

          </a>
          <p>
            Once logged in with a Spotify account, users can search and play
            songs, save songs into their library, and read the lyrics for a
            selected song. Each user is given a Spotify Access Token so that the
            client can make requests to Spotify Web API Node and Spotify Web
            Player. Track lyrics are obtained through Lyrics Searcher. Refresh
            Tokens are used to let the application get new Access Tokens without
            having to ask the user to log in again.
